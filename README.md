Educoin Core Staging Repository (Version 1.0.0)
===========================


What is Educoin Core?
-------------

Educoin is an experimental digital currency that enables instant, private
payments to anyone, anywhere in the world. Educoin uses peer-to-peer technology
to operate with no central authority: managing transactions and issuing money
are carried out collectively by the network.

Users hold the crypto keys to their own money and transact directly with each other, 
with the help of a P2P network to check for double-spending. Educoin Core is the 
name of the open source software which enables the use of this currency.

For more information, as well as an immediately useable, binary version of
the Educoin Core software, see https://educoins.io
